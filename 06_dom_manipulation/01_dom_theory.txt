What is the DOM?
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs 
and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
1. Core DOM - standard model for all document types
2. XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
3. HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
* The HTML elements as objects
* The properties of all HTML elements
* The methods to access all HTML elements
* The events for all HTML elements
* In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.


With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


DOM manipulation in JavaScript refers to the practice of changing the Document Object Model (DOM) 
of an HTML document using JavaScript code. The DOM represents the structure and content of an 
HTML document as a tree-like structure of nodes, where each node represents an element or attribute 
of the document. By manipulating the DOM, you can change the layout, content, and behavior of a web page 
in response to user interactions or other events. There are several methods for manipulating the 
DOM in JavaScript, 
including :-
            document.getElementById(), 
            document.querySelector(), and 
            document.querySelectorAll(). 
These methods are used to select and modify elements in the DOM based on their attributes or IDs.
