/**
 
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

*JavaScript Function Syntax*
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

*FUNCTION RETURN*
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute 
the code after the invoking statement.
Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

*Why Functions?*
1. With functions you can reuse code
2. You can write code that can be used many times.
3. You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
